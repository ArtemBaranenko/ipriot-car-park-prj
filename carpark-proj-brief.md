# Scenario

## Project Brief

The City of Moondalup is progressively embracing smart city initiatives to enhance urban living, improve efficiency in city services, and promote sustainable practices. As part of this initiative, the city council is eager to transition to a smart parking solution to optimize carpark usage, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance the overall parking experience for residents and visitors.
You have been contracted to create a prototype solution that uses sensors and displays to provide timely information about available parking bays as well as relevant information about weather and other community messages.
The city’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), has outlined the following requirements:

- The system must accurately track and show availability of bays in real-time.
- The displays must be able to show ambient temperature and arbitrary announcements.
- The system must **store** the scanned license plates of cars.
- The system must work in uncontrolled car parks.
- The display must be **updated** promptly as cars _enter or exit_.
- The system should be robust, easy to maintain, and scalable for future enhancements.
- The application must follow best coding practices and include unit tests.
- You must use Git and GitHub for version management.

## Technical Specification

- Create at least three classes
- At least one class must include three or more parameters
- At least one class must aggregate another class
- At least one class must include a list (array) of primitive data types
- You should demonstrate an example of polymorphism
- Include at least two unit tests
- Read and write configuration from a file
- Allow carpark to be constructed either from a direct call or via the configuration file (two options for object construction)
- Create a main.py demonstrating the core interaction between instances of your classes
- Use PEP8 throughout your code and docstrings for major functions within your code
- Record and provide evidence of debugging
- Apply at least three different documentation conventions (readme, docstring, comments)
